# Soundify

Soundify is a Spotify clone, built with an ElectronJS frontend as well as a backend built with ExpressJS. This is not meant for commercial use, it is built simply for me to learn new technologies. The backend is packed into a docker compose for ease of use :)

## Getting started

To setup a dev environment, please do the following steps:

1. Create a `.env` file resembling the `.env.example` file

2. Start the backend `cd backend` `npm i` `docker compose up`

   - Configure the database in `.env`

3. Open a new terminal in `/app` and run `npm run dev`
